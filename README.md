# **DecentraID**  
### *Decentralized Identity Management and Verification*

---

## **Problem Statement**  
Centralized authentication servers face critical issues:  
- Single points of failure  
- Limited user control  
- High vulnerability to data breaches  

These challenges, compounded by a rising frequency of identity-based attacks, underscore the need for a decentralized solution that enhances security, empowers users, and mitigates the risks inherent in centralized identity management.

## **How DecentraID Solves Key Challenges**

- **Stronger Security**  
  Removes single points of failure; minimizes breach risks.  

- **User Control & Privacy**  
  Users control their data; ZKPs (Zero-Knowledge Proofs) verify identity privately.  

- **Reduced Attack Surface**  
  Blockchain-based security resists identity attacks.  

- **Cross-Platform Access**  
  One decentralized ID works seamlessly across platforms.  

- **Scalable & Reliable**  
  Decentralized nodes enable efficient scaling.  

- **Cost-Efficient**  
  Reduces dependency on central servers, lowering costs.
